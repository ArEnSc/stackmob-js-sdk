# The StackMob's Javascript SDK

The StackMob Javascript SDK provides an easy way for developers to access StackMob's backend REST API services: datastore, file storage via S3, authentication via OAuth 2.0, and more.

To get started, visit the <a href="https://www.stackmob.com/platform/help/tutorials/html5_js_sdk" target="_blank">Getting Started</a>.

*Do not link from your project to this file.  This is a living JS file and will change while in development.  Stable release versions of the JS SDK will be published officially to `static.stackmob.com/js/stackmob-js-x.x.x-min.js`*
