## StackMob JavaScript SDK Change Log

### v0.9.0

**UPGRADE NOTES**

* `apiURL` init parameter has been superseded by `apiDomain` that will respect SSL preferences determined by the `secure` init parameter.
* You no longer need to specify appName or clientSubdomain in the StackMob.init() method.

**FEATURE**

* Added configurable security policies to determine which methods are performed over SSL (`secure` init parameter)
  * Always - All requests will be made over HTTPS
  * Never - All requests will be made over HTTP
  * Mixed (Default) - Only authentication and user creation methods will be made over HTTPS
* Added `secureRequest` parameter to force SSL for any method.
* Added `fullyPopulateUser` flag on `login` calls to populate the user from the server if set to true. Default false.
* Updating callbacks to match Backbone 1.0 `success(model, result, options)` and `error(model, result, options)`


**FIX**

* Support multiple custom users
  * Moved custom `loginField` and `passwordField` on a user schema to `StackMob.User.extend({ loginField: ..., passwordField: ... })`
  * `StackMob.init({ loginField: ..., passwordField: ... });` deprecated but backwards supported
* Added `binaryFields` declaration to `StackMob.Model` to fix saving of binary fields that have already been converted to S3 urls

### v0.8.1 - March 15, 2013

**FIX**

* Facebook logins will now stayed logged in when setting `keepLoggedIn` flag to `true` in [login() method](https://developer.stackmob.com/sdks/js/api#a-login).

### v0.8.0 - Feb 14, 2013

**FEATURE**

* CORS Support - [Manage your CORS domain settings in the StackMob Dashboard](https://dashboard.stackmob.com/module/api/settings)

**FIX**

* Authentication callback bug fixes

**UPGRADE NOTES**

Prior to v0.8.0, the default API URL was '/' meaning all API calls were proxied through a relative URL of whatever domain it is being run from (to adhere to the [same origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript)). 
With CORS support, the default API URL for JS SDK 0.8.0+ is `http://api.stackmob.com`.

Upgrade Steps:

* If your app is deployed to stackmobapp.com ([StackMob HTML5 Hosting](https://marketplace.stackmob.com/module/html5)), no action is necessary. The SDK will auto-detect this and revert 
to a relative API URL and use API proxying (not CORS). This is done to reduce reliance on CORS compatibility.
* If your app is deployed on a 
[Custom Domain](https://marketplace.stackmob.com/module/customdomains) on [StackMob HTML5 Hosting](https://marketplace.stackmob.com/module/html5), you must either 
set the init variable [useRelativePathForAjax](http://developer.stackmob.com/sdks/js/api#a-init) to true to enable relative API proxying, or 
[add the custom domain to your CORS whitelist](https://dashboard.stackmob.com/module/cors/settings) to use CORS.  Setting `useRelativePathForAjax: true` is recommended.
* To use the JS SDK on a non-[StackMob HTML5 hosted](https://marketplace.stackmob.com/module/html5) domain, [add that domain to your CORS whitelist](https://dashboard.stackmob.com/module/cors/settings).

[Browser compatibility for CORS can be found here](http://caniuse.com/#feat=cors).  If compatibility is a concern,
StackMobâ€™s HTML5 Hosting and Custom Domain services both offer API proxying and work without using CORS.

### v0.7.0 - Jan 15, 2013

**FEATURE**

* Asynchronous authentication check methods (`isLoggedIn`) that will renew OAuth2 Refresh Tokens if necessary

**FIX**

* Fix `apiURL` so that the API URL applies for Custom Code methods. It previously did not.
* Bug with OAuth signing of non-GET custom code calls
